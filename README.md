# gotolino
A Golang implementation of the tolinojs project.

### How to
- download the binary file (gotolino)
- create a settings.txt along with it, that looks like this:
```txt
notesTxtLocation=ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_NOTES
notesSavingPath=ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_THE_LOCATION_WHERE_THE_NOTES_SHOULD_BE_SAVED
```

With <code>notesTxtLocation</code> you set the path where the TXT is located that your tolino has generated.
With <code>notesSavingPath</code> you set the location where you want to save your notes as single markdown files.

- double click on the binary
